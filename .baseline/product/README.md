# {{ .productname }}

A multi-tenant SaaS on Cloudflare alone, kept as an
[Orun](https://github.com/sourceplane/orun) desired-state repository:
twelve bounded-context Workers behind one public edge API, a Next.js console
on Workers + Static Assets, and Cloudflare D1 and KV as the data plane.
Merges to `main` deploy it to `stage` and `prod`.

## Live deployment

<!-- 08-docs:begin -->
Not recorded yet. The bootstrap's last phase probes every live URL and
writes the addresses, the workspace and the secrets the product uses into
[ai/context/deployment.md](ai/context/deployment.md); how the product
deploys and how to operate it is in
[ai/context/operations.md](ai/context/operations.md).

## What is here

| Surface | Where |
|---|---|
| The public HTTP API — the only Worker with a public route | `apps/api-edge` |
| Bounded-context Workers (identity, membership, projects, policy, events, config, metering, billing, notifications, webhooks, integrations, admin), reached only through the edge | `apps/*-worker` |
| The console | `apps/web-console-next` |
| API, tenancy, event and error types shared by every Worker and the console | `packages/contracts` |
| D1 executor, repositories and migrations | `packages/db` |
| SDK and CLI | `packages/sdk`, `packages/cli` |
| Data plane (D1 per environment, the edge's KV) and the parked custom domain | `infra/terraform/*` |
| Migration runner, applied on merge | `infra/db-migrate` |
| Tests, one suite per component | `tests/*` |
| Environments, lanes, the pinned composition stack, the workspace | `intent.yaml` |
| Each component's overview, architecture and runbook | `apps/*/docs`, `packages/*/docs` |

## Getting started

Node.js 20 or later and pnpm 10 or later.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

With the `orun` CLI at the version `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pins:

```bash
orun validate --intent intent.yaml
orun plan --changed --intent intent.yaml --output plan.json
```

## How it deploys

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `orun plan --changed`, then one lane per
group of planned jobs with `orun run --remote-state` against the workspace
`intent.yaml` declares. A pull request plans and verifies; a merge to `main`
deploys the changed components to `stage` and then `prod`. `dev` only
verifies. The deploy credentials are brokered per run from the workspace's
Cloudflare connection, CI signs in over GitHub OIDC, and Terraform state is
kept by Orun Cloud — nothing provider-shaped is stored in this repository or
in GitHub. [ai/context/operations.md](ai/context/operations.md) is the full
operating contract.

## Working with D1

D1 is SQLite, and the code is explicit about what that costs:

- **No interactive transactions.** `executor.transaction(...)` runs its
  statements in order with no rollback. Where all-or-nothing matters, use a
  single statement with `RETURNING`, or an upsert with `ON CONFLICT`.
- **SQLite types.** Timestamps and JSON documents are text, booleans are
  0/1; `@saas/db/json` owns the decoding.
- **No schemas.** A bounded context's tables share a name prefix
  (`identity_users`, `membership_organizations`), enforced by the
  repositories.

## What needs your credentials

Sign-in with GitHub or Google needs OAuth client secrets; billing needs a
Polar access token, a webhook secret and `POLAR_PRODUCT_MAP` pointed at your
own Polar products; email needs Cloudflare Email Service set up for a
verified sending domain. The header comments of
`apps/identity-worker/wrangler.template.jsonc` and
`apps/billing-worker/wrangler.template.jsonc` say how each secret is set,
and `orun secrets set <KEY> --org <workspace> --env <env>` sets a runtime
secret in the workspace.

## Custom domain

The product answers on workers.dev from its first deploy. To serve it on
your own domain, follow "Setting the domain later" in
[ai/context/operations.md](ai/context/operations.md).
