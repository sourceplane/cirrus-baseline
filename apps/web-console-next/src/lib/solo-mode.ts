 * M0 / Solo profile — the console (UI) side of the single SOLO_MODE switch.

 * The api-edge ENFORCES the profile (404s suppressed routes); this flag makes
 * the console match it: hide org/team/project surfaces, drop the org switcher,
 * relabel "Organization" → "Account", and land on the one auto-provisioned
 * personal workspace. See specs/profiles/solo-m0.md.
 *
 * Sourced from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLO_MODE`, inlined at build time (next.config.mjs
 * defaults it to "true" for this CirrusBaseline instance). Set it to "false" and rebuild
 * to restore the full multi-tenant baseline — nothing here is removed, only
 * gated, so the switch is fully reversible.
